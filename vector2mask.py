# Installation:

# Place the vector2mask.py file in .gimp-2.8\plug-ins\ folder.
# In Gimp, right click on active layer and run "Vector to Mask" command.

# Usage:
# The plug-in requires the names of the layer and the path to use as mask to be identical.
# Select the layer, right click and choose "Vector to Mask" command.
# This will create or update the existing mask for the layer.
# The mask is feathered by 2 pixels and can be adjusted additionally with the Levels Tool.
# If you don't want this step to be performed comment out the line in the script below.

from gimpfu import *

def plugin_vector2mask(image, drawable):
	#create list of existing vectors for the active image
	vectors_list = image.vectors
	# loop the list to see if any path has the same name as the active layer
	for v in vectors_list:
		if(drawable.name == v.name):
			#if found - check if the layer already have mask and destroy it if true
			if (drawable.mask != None):
				drawable.remove_mask(1) # 1 - removes mask, 0 - applies it
			v.to_selection()
			# optional feather selection by 2, comment out the line below to disable it
			pdb.plug_in_gauss_rle2(image,image.selection,2.0,2.0)
			# 4 - creates mask from selection
			drawable.add_mask(drawable.create_mask(4))
			pdb.gimp_selection_none(image)
